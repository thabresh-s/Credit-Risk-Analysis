## Credit Risk Analysis with Machine Learning
### Predicting the risk of client default using XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost

- Credit risk is associated with the possibility of a client failing to meet contractual obligations, such as mortgages, credit card debts, and other types of loans.

- Minimizing the risk of default is a major concern for financial institutions. For this reason, commercial and investment banks, venture capital funds, asset management companies and insurance firms, to name a few, are increasingly relying on technology to predict which clients are more prone to stop honoring their debts.

- Machine Learning models have been helping these companies to improve the accuracy of their credit risk analysis, providing a scientific method to identify potential debtors in advance.
